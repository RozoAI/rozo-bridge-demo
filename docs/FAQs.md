ROZO Intents — Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. What is ROZO Intents?

ROZO Intents is an intent-based stablecoin SDK that enables users to transfer USDC and other stablecoins between chains like Stellar, Base, Polygon, and Solana with zero confusion and near-zero error.
It is designed for real-world payment speed and reliability, combining:
	•	Stablecoin abstraction — transfer any stablecoin, on any chain
	•	Automatic route selection for the fastest bridge path
	•	Optimized capital flow and transparent status tracking

ROZO Intents approaches cross-chain transfers as both a technical and user-experience problem — making crypto payments feel as simple as Visa.

Rozo is supported by [Stellar Community Fund](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1djGXWBqdVdKZ), [Base](https://www.coinbase.com/developer-platform/discover/launches/summer-builder-grants), [Draper](https://x.com/draper_u/status/1940908242412183926) and [Circle Alliance](https://partners.circle.com/partner/rozo).
