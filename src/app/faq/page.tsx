    question: "What is Rozo Bridge?",
    answer:
      "Rozo Bridge is an intent-based stablecoin SDK that enables users to transfer USDC and other stablecoins between chains like Stellar, Base, Polygon, and Solana with zero confusion and near-zero error. It is designed for real-world payment speed and reliability, combining stablecoin abstraction, automatic route selection for the fastest bridge path, and optimized capital flow with transparent status tracking. Rozo approaches bridging as both a technical and user-experience problem — making crypto payments feel as simple as Visa. Rozo is supported by Stellar Community Fund, Base, Draper and Circle Alliance.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to receive my funds?",
    answer:
      "Most Rozo Bridge transfers complete in under few seconds. Fast route available on destination chain: 5 seconds. Requires liquidity rebalance from another chain: 10–20 minutes. Network-level fallback route: up to 1–2 hours. If your transfer takes longer than the quoted time, you can contact our support team via Discord.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which blockchains does Rozo Bridge support?",
    answer:
      "Rozo currently supports transfers between: Stellar, Base, Polygon, Solana, BNB Chain (coming soon), and Arbitrum & Polygon (coming soon).",
  },
  {
    question: "What tokens can I bridge?",
    answer:
      "Rozo supports stablecoins and assets including: USDC, USDT (coming soon), and other stablecoins (coming soon).",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my transfer is stuck or delayed?",
    answer:
      "If a transfer appears delayed beyond the estimated window: 1) Check the status page in your transaction history. 2) Verify the on-chain hash on the source and destination networks. 3) If still unresolved after 2 hours, contact hi@rozo.ai or our Discord Dev Support channel.",
